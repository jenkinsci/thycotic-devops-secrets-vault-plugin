# Release

## Setup Tools

- `aqua install` will ensure github cli, changie, and task are setup for cli invocation.
- `task` to list the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) commands available.

## General Process

- `task config` to set the github cli default to `jenkinsci/thycotic-devops-secrets-vault-plugin` instead of the forked branch.
- `task bump` to generate changelog and update release notes.
- `task release` to create the draft release.

## Other

- Use changie to add entries.
- The release body, ie the results from `cat .changes/$(change latest).md` would need to match the identified "interesting categories" emojis from Jenkins. [Interesting](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/interesting-category-action/blob/main/action.yaml)
  - Since we are using the "using" workflow I can't pass this in as an override to match changie so I've updated changie config to match the items that should be interesting.

  - Value: `default: '[💥🚨🎉🐛⚠🚀🌐👷]|:(boom|tada|construction_worker):'`
  - The labels for the pull request must be used if leveraging the reusable workflows as well. [labels](https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/ce466227c534c42820a597cb8e9cac2f2334920a/.github/release-drafter.yml#L9-L50)
